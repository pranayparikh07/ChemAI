🎯 QUICK SUMMARY - TEAM ORGANIZATION FOR MONTH 1
================================================================================

DATE: February 2, 2026
PROJECT: ChemAI - AI-Driven Molecular Drug Discovery
TEAM SIZE: 3 people (Pranay, Vishwa, Shreya)
DURATION: 1 Month (4 weeks)

================================================================================
📍 FOLDER LOCATIONS
================================================================================

Your tasks are in:

PRANAY:   d:\ChemAI\TEAM_PRANAY\MONTH1_TASKS.txt
          → 4 tasks, 13 sub-tasks
          → 10 deliverable documents

VISHWA:   d:\ChemAI\TEAM_VISHWA\MONTH1_TASKS.txt
          → 5 tasks, 20 sub-tasks
          → 18 deliverable files + data

SHREYA:   d:\ChemAI\TEAM_SHREYA\MONTH1_TASKS.txt
          → 6 tasks, 24 sub-tasks
          → Full knowledge graph + reasoning

================================================================================
📊 WHAT'S ALREADY DONE
================================================================================

✅ Agent System - All 5 agents working
✅ ML Models - 4 models trained (bioactivity, properties, toxicity, drug-likeness)
✅ Molecular Generation - Genetic algorithm working
✅ Web Dashboard - Beautiful HTML interface
✅ Testing Framework - Comprehensive test suite
✅ Database - ChEMBL 36 ready

🟡 Fixed Today:
✅ Dashboard now shows pIC50 and QED scores correctly

================================================================================
❓ WHAT'S LEFT TO DO
================================================================================

PRANAY - Weeks 1-4:
  ☐ Week 1: Literature review (molecular generation, RL in chemistry, agents)
  ☐ Week 2: Gap analysis (causal reasoning, autonomous loops)
  ☐ Week 3: Research problem formulation
  ☐ Week 4: System architecture design

VISHWA - Weeks 1-4:
  ☐ Week 1: Download datasets, clean 50k+ molecules
  ☐ Week 2: Create graph representations, extract features
  ☐ Week 3: Build feature matrix, calculate properties
  ☐ Week 4: Statistics, visualization, train/val/test splits

SHREYA - Weeks 1-4:
  ☐ Week 1: Design KG schema (nodes, edges, properties)
  ☐ Week 2: Extract data from multiple sources
  ☐ Week 3: Load into Neo4j, create query patterns
  ☐ Week 4: Build embeddings, reasoning engine
