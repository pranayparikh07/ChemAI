DELIVERABLE 1: GAP ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Document: gap_analysis_complete.txt
Status: ✓ COMPLETE

Six Major Gaps Identified:

  GAP 1: LACK OF CAUSAL REASONING
  ------
  Problem: Current systems use correlation (ML models) but not causation
  Impact: Black-box predictions, poor generalization, regulatory concerns
  Solution: Knowledge graph causal paths, mechanistic understanding
  Expected ROI: 40-50% fewer off-target effects, 30% faster optimization
  
  Proposed Implementation in Month 2:
    - Integrate KG causal edges
    - Add mechanistic reasoning module
    - Link to target-ligand interactions
    - Enable chemist-friendly explanations

  GAP 2: MISSING AUTONOMOUS FEEDBACK LOOPS
  --------
  Problem: Systems require human guidance at each step
  Impact: Slow discovery, no learning from failures
  Solution: Autonomous agents with long-term memory and learning
  Expected ROI: 10-100x faster cycles, continuous improvement
  
  Proposed Implementation in Month 2:
    - Multi-agent feedback loops
    - Long-term memory system
    - Adaptive strategy selection
    - Learning from successes/failures

  GAP 3: LIMITED MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION
  ----------
  Problem: Simple weighting loses important nuances
  Impact: Tradeoffs not well explored, greedy optimization

  Expected ROI: 50% better late-stage candidates
  
  Proposed Implementation in Month 2:
    - Pareto optimization module
    - Constraint satisfaction framework

  GAP 4: INSUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE INTEGRATION
  --------
  Problem: Siloed data sources, no cross-domain reasoning
  Impact: Missed patterns, incomplete context
  Solution: Unified KG, cross-domain embeddings, reasoning
  Expected ROI: 20-30% accuracy improvement, better safety
  
  Current Status: ADDRESSED with KG construction by Shreya

  GAP 5: LACK OF EXPLAINABILITY
  ----------
  Problem: Black-box predictions can't be explained
  Impact: Low regulatory acceptance, hard to debug
  Solution: Graph-based explanations, mechanistic rule extraction
  Expected ROI: 100% interpretable, faster regulatory approval
  
  Current Status: ADDRESSED with reasoning engine by Shreya

  GAP 6: COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY
  -----------
  Problem: Systems too slow to explore large chemical spaces
  Impact: High cost, limited scalability
  Solution: Hierarchical filtering, caching, parallel processing
  Expected ROI: 10-100x speedup, 90% cost reduction
  
  Proposed Implementation in Month 2:
